<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Our team was formed at the very last minute due to unforeseen circumstances, however we’re determined to submit the best work we can within the time constraints. Our team is comprised of three members; Ahilan Anandasivam, Jianming Li and me, Joshua Marson. First up is Ahilan, student number S3931941. Ahilan is Australian; however, his cultural background is Sri Lankan, and he is currently living in England. Ahilan is also a man of many talents, performing and writing classical music and practices martial arts. He is also multilingual, knowing languages such as; German, English, Tamil, basic Italian and learning Chinese. His interest in Information Technology (IT) began through E-commerce. However, he is now mainly focused on social media platforms and the way they are evolving culture. He has also gained basic knowledge of Java through a previous course and has some experience with web design platforms including Wix, Shopify and Squarespace. Next is Jianming Li, student number S3934009. Jianming prefers to be known as James as he is a huge fan of the James Bond Movies. James is currently studying for a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at University of New South Wales (UNSW), set to graduate in 2022. James’ cultural background is Chinese, with both Cantonese and Mandarin being his mother tongue, whilst also being able to speak English and Deutsch. He came to Sydney when he was 17 and fell in love with the amazing Harbour views and beautiful beaches, which led him to stay. He loves collecting and building Lego in his free time, currently having a collection amassing over 30 sets. Most of his collection being Technic sets, some of which include real-life functions such as using a gearbox or steering system. James’ interest in IT is centered around the convenience innovative technologies bring to the human lifestyle. He is also passionate about how businesses can grow faster and effectively using these technologies. He has prior knowledge of programming languages python and C while also learning HTML. The final member is me, Joshua Marson, student number S3934890. I was born and raised in Sydney, but have always wanted to live, work and travel abroad. Some of my hobbies include video games and soccer, and I have a passion for Pokémon and the marvel universe (Iron Man being my favourite character). My interest in IT began in high school. I would spend recess and lunch in the computer lab with friends, playing games and learning new programs. I then began building computers for myself, my family and my friends. This helped me learn and build a larger passion for IT. This is my first real attempt at studying beyond high school and I'm really enjoying the course so far. I have little experience with python and HTML; however, I am learning so much already and cannot wait to see where this course takes me.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Determined by the Meyers-Briggs test to be an ENFP-T, which is an extroverted and intuitive personality. This is because he is a people person with great leadership abilities while also being able to sense the dynamics in the group and get everyone involved in the task at hand.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">He is also a tactile learner and loves to learn and work in a hands-on environment. This means he is great at being handed an immense task and getting it done by doing what he needs to when he needs to do it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His personal brand is that of an explorer, always seeking new challenges and adventures.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Meyers-Brigg test indicates that James is a commander or ENTJ-A. Traits associated with this personality are as follows: Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging and Assertive. This means James isn’t afraid to take charge or give his opinion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">His learning style test showed he is predominantly a tactile learner, while also relying on visual learning. This means he is like Ahilan; in that he learns better when he can be hands-on. Although he can also learn very well from reading or following visual tutorials.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">James also took the Big 5 personality test which measures openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness and neuroticism or (OCEAN). The results show conscientiousness as his stand-out attribute, with openness and agreeableness high on the chart as well.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The Meyers-Briggs test resulted in me being classed as a defender or ISFJ-T. This means I'm introverted but willing to defend myself or others when I feel I need to. The defender's personality is based on observation and judging traits, which allows me to watch and listen, then speak up when necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">My second test was a creativity test. This test showed that my creativity is a “work in progress”. This means that I should look to others and collaborate with them to boost my creativity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The final test was a learning style test. This told me that I am reliant on hearing, being an auditory learner. Having problems and information explained to me or being talked through activities is my most effective method of learning and processing information.</span></p>
